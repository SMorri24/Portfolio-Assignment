    <h2> About Me</h2>
    <p> Hey there- I'm Shaun and l live in Denver, CO! I grew up here in the Mile High city and then moved away for a number of years to explore and live in other places. Places like Chicago, Detroit, Idaho and Ukraine! I recently graduated with my MBA with a focus in Operations and IT Management. 
        Professionally, for the last 6 years I worked in Healthcare. More specifcally Healthcare Operations Management and Consulting. I worked for a couple different fortune 500 companies, and some small business. During my time in the Healthcare space, I was involved in IT Healthcare EMR software development and deployment and healthcare finance systems. I also spent time working on projects in technology hardware R&D, strategy and innovation. After being around tech development for so long and not being able to actually do it, I decided this is the path and the time to become a developer. 
        I love using creative processes and logic to problem solve and come up with new ideas to bring innovation and change to the world around me!  I'm person of many passions like: sports, fitness, outdoors, cooking, traveling, coaching high school baseball, but most importantly- I'm a Dad!  I'm excited to start this adventure!
